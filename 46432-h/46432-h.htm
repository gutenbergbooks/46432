<p class="afterdrop"><span class="fstwd"><span class="hidden">O</span>f</span> the twelve regular methods
of proceeding in the
courts of criminal jurisdiction
in England, the last&mdash;that
of execution&mdash;is the only one
that is particularly treated of in the
following pages. “Sus. per col.” has
been, as it were, the only warrant; but
in attempting to trace some items in a
record that runs like a scarlet thread
through the long course of events that
constitutes history, it has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
possible, on the one hand, to avoid
touching upon other modes and details
of capital punishment in England, or,
on the other, to escape from straying
somewhat into the catalogue of what
Blackstone calls “the shocking apparatus
of death and punishment” to be
met with in the criminal codes of other
European nations. And while this
course has been pursued,&mdash;certainly
rather by way of comment and illustration,
than with any desire to “accumulate
horrors on horror’s head,”&mdash;an
endeavour has also been made, in
carrying down the pitiful story, to
dissipate some of the clouds of mystery
and fable that have clustered round
the Gibbet. Removed, as we happily
are by time, from a period when it
was lawful, and even accepted as
fitting, that men who bore the brand
of Cain should be made the subject of
a revolting and disgraceful spectacle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
we can approach the matter without
prejudice, and with proper calmness;
but it is, perhaps, not so easy at once
to realize how great is the change that
has taken place in national feeling and
sympathy since George the Third was
king. And if humanity would recoil
to-day with abhorrence from the actual
gibbet, sensation itself would be
stunned at the punishment for High
Treason,&mdash;at the drawing and quartering
of patriots, whose names may
shine in history “through their tears
like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy
stream.” It will be borne in mind
that the gallows and the gibbet are
the most ancient instruments of capital
punishment in the world; as such they
have a distinct archæological as well
as a legal interest; and, inasmuch as
it appears that the custom of exposing
human bodies in irons and chains is
almost peculiar to this country, doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>less
no further motive need be adduced
for now bringing together these scattered
English notices. And it is
thought that what may be lacking in
other respects may be somewhat compensated
for by the historical and
antiquarian features, so that, in spite
of its rather ominous title, the book
may be found not entirely repellent.</p>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="fstwd"><span class="hidden">T</span>o</span> rest at last in the ground,
to be buried in the sepulchre
of their fathers, was
accounted by the Jews as
the greatest honour and happiness, and
throughout the Old Testament the expression
for death is sleeping, implying
lying tranquil and undisturbed. Thus
David, Azariah, and Jotham “slept with
their fathers, and were buried in the
city of David”&mdash;“for so He giveth
His beloved sleep.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, to die an unnatural
or violent death, to be cast
out of the grave like an abominable
branch, to be as a carcass exposed in
the sight of the sun, or trodden under
foot, and not to be joined with their
fathers in burial, was ever esteemed a
note of infamy, and a kind of curse.
“And if a man have committed a sin
worthy of death, and he be to be
put to death, and thou hang him on a
tree: his body shall not remain all
night upon the tree, but thou shalt in
any wise bury him that day (for he
that is hanged is accursed of God);
that thy land be not defiled.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> So
Jehoiakim was threatened with the
want of even ordinary burial, and to
be cast out like carrion into some
remote and sordid place. It was a
severe sentence, “He shall be buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
with the burial of an ass, drawn and
cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Again, Jeremiah foretelling the
desolation of the Jews, “Their
carcasses will I give to be meat for
the fowls of the heaven, and for the
beasts of the earth,”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> “and no man
shall fray them away;”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and in
another place we are told that their
bones shall be “spread before the
sun, and the moon, and all the host
of heaven, ... they shall not be
gathered, nor be buried.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In the denunciation of Jehoiakim,
in that picturesque and striking scene,
when the king burnt the roll of
Baruch, it is recorded against him:
“His dead body shall be cast out
in the day to the heat, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
night to the frost.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> So great,
indeed, was the dread among the
ancient Jews that the dead body
should be treated with derision or
contumely, that the Preacher expressed
and summed up the general
sentiment in these words: “If a man
... have no burial, I say that an
untimely birth is better than he.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>As with the Jews so it was with
the Egyptians. They refused burial
to executed criminals and gave their
bodies to the birds and beasts. For
instance, Joseph said to the chief
baker, “Yet within three days shall
Pharaoh lift up thine head from off
thee, and shall hang thee on a tree;
and the birds shall eat thy flesh from
off thee.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And so it came to pass.</p>

<p>We may gather, again, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
short and touching story of the long
watches of Rizpah, how deep was the
solicitude that the dead should not be
polluted by birds and beasts,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> or from
the ghastly fate of Amasa, whose
mangled corpse was covered with a
cloth by a mere bystander&mdash;one of
Joab’s men<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;in order that the people
might not be shocked by looking upon
it&mdash;how strong was the feeling in
those days against the wanton exposure
of the divine image.</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply
examples from these sources, but
with further regard to the seven sons
of Saul it may be mentioned that
“the victims were not, as the Authorized
Version implies, hung, they
were crucified. The seven crosses
were planted in the rock on the
top of the sacred hill of Gibeah.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>...
The victims were sacrificed
at the beginning of barley harvest,&mdash;the
sacred and festal time of the
Passover&mdash;and in the full blaze of
the summer sun they hung till the
fall of the periodical rain in October....
She spread on the rocky floor
the thick mourning garment of black
sackcloth, which as a widow she wore,
and crouching there she watched that
neither vulture nor jackal should
molest the bodies.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Thus the
practice of gibbeting on a cross
was in use at least as early as in
the days of King David.</p>

<p>The misery of having no burial,
of rendering neither justice to the
earth nor mercy to the dead, was
recognized by the refined nature of
the Greeks, and, while they refused
decent sepulture to infamous persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and prisoners, they yearned both in
peace and war for quiet burial in the
ground, for they were dismayed at
the thought of burial at sea.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Thus Mezentius, in the Æneid of
Virgil, asks not Æneas to spare his
life,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">“but let my body have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last retreat of human kind, a grave.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>And, to take another and a notable
example, Hector, in his last hour,
beseeched Achilles to take the
ransom and suffer not his body to
be devoured by the dogs of the
Greeks, but to let the sons and
daughters of Troy give him burial
rites.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that a certain Achæus,
who disputed sovereign power with
Antiochus, was betrayed by a Cretan,
his limbs cut off, and his body
wrapped in the skin of an ass, and
exposed on a gibbet.</p>

<p>Pliny, in his “Natural History,”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
tells us that Tarquinius Priscus, who
died 578 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, ordered the dead bodies
of suicides to be exposed on a cross.
He was a powerful ruler, and an
Etruscan, and made his mark on
Rome. He came from Etruria when
it was in a high state of development,
and, no doubt, the practice of gibbeting
on a cross was early in use with
that ancient and gifted race.</p>

<p>The Romans dreaded the public
exposure of their bodies, and shipwreck,
no less than did the Greeks;
thus Ovid&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I fear not death, nor value how I die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free me from seas, no matter where I lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis somewhat, howsoe’er one’s breath depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In solid earth to lay one’s meaner part;<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>They refused sepulture to suicides,
for they thought it unreasonable that
any hands should bury him whose
own had destroyed himself, and they
withheld decent burial from criminals.</p>

<p>Albertus Leoninus, from the Low
Countries, one of the ablest lawyers
of the sixteenth century, says, speaking
of the Romans, “If any one killed
himself his body was cast out upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
dunghill to have common sepulture
with dogs, &amp;c.; but, however, it was
more customary to have his goods
confiscated, and his body hung on the
<i>furca</i>, or gibbet. All such persons as
hung upon this gibbet were, by the
laws, denied sepulture; and a sentry,
says Petronius, was set to watch them,
lest anybody should come by night
and steal them away.”<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The memorable
words, “and sitting down they
watched Him there,” cannot fail to
occur to the mind.</p>

<p>Our Saviour, with all reverence be
it said, was gibbeted&mdash;“nail’d, for our
advantage, on the bitter cross,”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and it was not until long after that
great Sacrifice&mdash;perhaps not until the
fifth century&mdash;that the cross became
the generally recognized Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
sign, and gradually took the place of
the Chi Rho ☧ emblem.</p>

<p>The number of Saints who suffered,
and were exposed upon the cross
or gibbet, is larger than that of
those who died the death in any
other way. Saint Ferreolus, martyred
in 212, is shown in “Die Iconographie
der Heiligen” with a gibbet
proper near him; Saint Anastatius,
martyred in 628, is represented in a
fresco in the church of SS. Vincent
and Anastatius, in Rome, upon a
gibbet, and pierced with many arrows;
and the martyr Saint Colman, who
suffered in the year 1012, is shown
in “Das Passional” of 1480 hanging
on a gibbet; in “Die Attribute der
Heiligen” he stands in the <i>sclavine</i> of
a pilgrim, with a rope in his hand,
indicating the manner of his death.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

</div>
<p class="afterdrop"><span class="fstwd"><span class="hidden">H</span>ence</span>, as we have seen,
gradually arose, side by
side with the capital punishment
of hanging on the
gallows in its simplicity&mdash;which may
be almost said to be as old as the
world itself&mdash;the custom of publicly
exposing human bodies upon gibbets
as warnings to others.</p>

<p>We gather from the “Vocabulary
of Archbishop Alfric,” of the tenth
century, and from early illuminated
MSS., that the gallows (galga) was
the usual mode of capital punishment
with the Anglo-Saxons. It can hardly
be doubted that in certain cases, as with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the Romans, the body of the “fordemed”&mdash;in
the case of decapitation
the “heafedleas bodi”&mdash;remained <i>in
terrorem</i> upon the gibbet, as Robert
of Gloucester, <i>circa</i> 1280, has it,
referring to his own times:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">“In gibet hii were an honge,”</p>

<p>though not necessarily as part of the
sentence, as appears always to have
been the case in England. An
obscure poet, Robert Brunne, has:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“First was he drawen for his felonie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&amp; as a thefe than on galwes hanged hie.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the numerous enactments concerning
the administration of the
criminal law, from the “Statute of
Westminster the First,” in 1277, to the
Act of George II. in 1752, no cognizance
is taken of the hanging of bodies
of criminals in chains. Such a treatment
of the carcass was, like the rack,
rather an engine of state than of law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>In Chauncy’s “History of Hertfordshire”
it is stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Soon after the King came to
Easthampstead, to recreate himself
with hunting, where he heard that
the bodies which were hanged here
were taken down from the gallowes,
and removed a great way from the
same; this so incensed the King that
he sent a writ, tested the 3rd of
August, Anno 1381, to the bailiffs of
this borrough, commanding them upon
sight thereof, to cause chains to be
made, and to hang the bodies in
them upon the same gallowes, there to
remain so long as one piece might
stick to another, according to the
judgement; but the townsmen, not
daring to disobey the King’s command,
hanged the dead bodies of
their neighbours again, to their great
shame and reproach, when they could
not get any other for any wages to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
come near the stinking carcasses, but
they themselves were compelled to
do so vile an office.”</p>

<p>This is an early record of a judgment
to hang <i>in terrorem</i>, and of
chains for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Gower, a contemporary poet, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And so after by the Lawe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was into the gibbet drawe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he above all other hongeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to a traitor it belongeth.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, during the second Northern
Rising, in 1536, the Duke of Norfolk
hung and quartered, as the usual
punishment for high treason, seventy-four
men at Carlisle, but the bodies
of Sir Robert Constable and Ashe
were hung in chains at Hull and York
respectively, as special cases. And
the Duke blames the Earl of Cumber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>land
for not having hung certain
persons in chains, as he had directed;
he airily adds, speaking of other
examples in Yorkshire, that “they
all hang still in chains, notwithstanding
that I have had no small intercession
for many of them.”<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>We gather from these items that,
although the public exposure of the
body entire formed no legal part of
the punishment for high treason, it
was sometimes added to it for the
increase of the shame. Whether the
ensanguined, quivering quarter of a
man, uplifted high on a gateway, had
a more deterrent effect than a whole
body slowly wasting away in chains,
we are, fortunately, not now called
upon curiously to determine.</p>

<p>It may here be mentioned that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
punishment for high treason differs in
one important particular from that for
murder. The head must be severed
from the body after the hanging.
The man must be drawn to the
gallows, and may not walk; he must
be cut down alive; his entrails taken
out and burnt before his face. Then
the head cut off&mdash;“headed,” and
finally the body quartered, and the
head and quarters remaining at the
king’s disposal. This was the English
law, as finally settled by the Statute
of Treason of 25 Edward III. (1351).
Such a sentence had been first carried
out, as it appears, upon a pirate named
William Marise, in 1241. Notable
examples are those of Wallace, 1305;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the elder and the younger Despencers,
1326;<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Hotspur, 1403;<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
are notable examples of shocking
barbarity; and not least memorable
though, happily, last, the executions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
after “the &mdash;45,” in exact accordance
with the ancient statute of four centuries
before. It is recorded that one
of these last victims struggled for a
few moments with William Stout of
Hexham, the fiend who, for twenty
guineas and the clothes, did the bloody
business, when he opened his bosom
and plucked out his heart.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It is a
dreadful subject, which one almost
shrinks from touching; but it may be
added that none of the thirty-two
sufferers at Carlisle for “the &mdash;45”
were hung in chains; they died the
ferocious death for high treason.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>As a curiously mitigated example
we may mention the case of the five
gentlemen attached to the Duke of
Gloucester, who were arraigned and
condemned for treason in 1447. They
were hung and immediately cut down
alive, stripped naked, their bodies
marked for quartering, and then, no
doubt very much to their surprise,
pardoned.</p>

<p>In Jersey, during the administration
of the Duke of Somerset, uncle of
Edward VI., two pirates were condemned
and hung in chains, as appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
from the following extract from the

<p>In Hakluyt’s “Voyages” we find
the following:&mdash;“Hereupon the
souldiers besought me not to hang
them, but rather let them be shot
throw, and then afterwards, if I
thought good, their bodies might be
hanged upon gibbets along the
haven’s mouth.”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The numerous allusions to gibbets
by Shakespeare show how common
they were in his day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>It will have been observed in the
foregoing remarks that the words
“gallows” and “gibbet” have been
used indifferently in the quotations
both for hanging a man from, and for
exposing him upon. It would appear
that, at least with us at the present
day, <i>gallows</i> is the thing upon
which men suffer, and <i>gibbet</i> the
object upon which they are set forth.
Hence the expression to gibbet a
man by calling attention publicly to
nefarious deeds, and, as the one thing
has given us the verb, so the other
furnishes the language with an adjective
equally expressive, and a person
by his “gallous” conduct stands a
fair chance of reaching the gallows
at last. A gallows may by particular
use become a gibbet, but not contrariwise,
and the same remark may
be said to apply to Potence and
Gibbet.</p>

With them the bodies of

<p>The last instance of burning at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
stake in Germany occurred at Berlin,
Aug. 18, 1786. It was then seventy
years since a similar punishment had
been carried out in the Prussian
capital. The criminal, stripped to his
shirt, was enclosed in a cage-like frame
which fastened with a door, and was
surrounded with wood and straw.</p>

<p>The last example of breaking on
the wheel was carried out at Vienna
in the above-mentioned year. The
victim was tortured with red-hot
pincers&mdash;<i>tenaillé</i>&mdash;as he walked to the
place of execution.</p>

<p>Weever, writing in 1631, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hee that commits treason, is
adjudged by our Lawes, to be hanged,
drawne, and quartered, and his diuided
limbes to be set vpon poles in some
eminent place, within some great
Market-towne, or Citie.</p>

<p>“He that commits that crying
sinne of murther, is vsually hanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
vp in chaines, so to continue vntill
his bodie be consumed, at or near
the place where the fact was perpetrated.</p>

<p>“Such as are found guilty of other
criminall causes, as Burglarie, Felonie,
or the like, after a little hanging are
cut downe and indeed buried, but
seldom in Christian mould (as we say)
nor in the sepulchres of their fathers,
except their fathers have their graves
made neare, or vnder the gallowes.</p>

<p>“And we vse to bury such as lay
violent hands vpon themselues, in or
neare to the high wayes, with a stake
thrust through their bodies, to terrifie
all passengers, by that so infamous
and reproachfull a buriall; not to
make such their finall passage out of
this present world.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>It is important to notice, as regards
hanging in chains, that Weever says
“vsually,” not “always;” and although
in the preceding paragraph,
when speaking of treason, he says the
punishment for it “is adjudged by
our Lawes,” he makes no such remark
now, but is significantly silent as to
the legal nature of chains; but, from
the way Weever puts it, it must have
been a common practice at that time
in England.</p>

<p>In Scotland, Lord Dreghorn, writing
in 1774, says, “The first instance
of hanging in chains is in March,
1637, in the case of Macgregor, for
theft, robbery, and slaughter; he was
sentenced to be hanged in a chenzie
on the gallowlee till his corpse
rot.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1688 one Standsfield, found guilty
of treason for cursing his father, and
accession to his father’s murder, was
sentenced to be hung at the Mercat
Cross till he was dead, his tongue to
be cut out and burnt upon a scaffold,
his right hand to be cut off and affixed
on the East Port of Haddington, and
his body to be carried&mdash;not drawn&mdash;to
the gallowlee between Leith and
Edinburgh, “and there to be hanged
in chains, and his name, fame, memory,
and honours to be extinct, and his
arms to be riven forth and delet out
of the books of arms.”<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Thus the
hanging in chains formed part of the
sentence in Scotland which it never
did in England for any crime, if we
except the solitary instance at Easthampstead
in 1381.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>We may now pass for a short time
to France. In that country the
gallows was a feudal right which,
held in the first place <i>in capite</i>, could
be sub-infeudated to lesser vassals,
but they could at any time be suppressed
by the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Voltaire, at
Ferney, had several gallows or <i>potences</i>,
and his reassuring speech about them
to his friends was, “I have as many
gallows as would suffice to hang half
the monarchs in Europe, and half the
monarchs in Europe deserve no loftier
position.”</p>

<p>Charles V. (1380-1422) granted
leave to certain districts to have
gallows&mdash;<i>fourches patibulaires</i>&mdash;with
two posts, and a curious question
arose in consequence of the Count
of Rhodez having placed his armorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
bearings upon a gibbet of this kind
against the prerogative of the king;
it was an abuse of privilege, and
implied the seizing of justice. Such
gibbets, of which the number of pillars,
or, if of wood, posts, varied from two
to eight, according to the quality of
the lord, were used both to hang
criminals from, and for the suspension,
exposure, or gibbeting of the bodies
of men executed elsewhere upon temporary
gallows. The sites of these
<i>fourches patibulaires</i> are recognizable
at the present day by the names,
“La Justice,” “La grande Justice,”
titles corresponding to our own more
humble and prosaic terms, “Gibbet
Hill,” or “Gibbet Field.” The English
gibbets have never assumed, like
those in France, any monumental
character.</p>

<p>It is certain that there was already
at the end of the twelfth century a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
monumental gibbet on the eminence
of Montfaucon, between the faubourgs
of St. Martin and the Temple, in
Paris. Sauval gives a remarkable
description of it as at that period,
and, although he does not give his
authorities quite in the way English
antiquaries might wish, there can be
no doubt, from the documents of the
thirteenth century, that the monument
was as Sauval describes it. It underwent
extensive repairs, if not partial
re-building, in 1425, when forty-eight
old beams were replaced by new ones.
It is also recorded that in 1466 “at
the Great Justice of Paris were
attached and nailed fifty-two iron
chains to hang and strangle the
malefactors who have been and shall
be sent here by order of Justice.”
Eight great new ladders were subsequently
added, and all these details
are corroborated by a representation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in an old tapestry at the Hotel de
Ville.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>From these very curious records
the genius of Viollet le Duc has produced
an illustration which is here
reproduced. It will speak for itself
better than any description, and it
will be only necessary to say that the
fourth, or open side, allowed access
to the interior by a broad flight of
steps leading to a wide platform on
what may be called the first floor,
running round the three sides of the
interior. Upon this platform the
executioner, with his ladders and
assistants, performed his office.</p>

<p class="caption">GIBBET OF MONTFAUCON.<br />
(<i>From Viollet le Duc, “Dictionnaire raisonné.”</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>This arrangement enabled the
designer of the building to form a
vault in the centre, lighted by a
small loop. It had an entrance, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
“eye,” in the crown, at the crossing
of the ribs, through which were swept
from time to time the bones and
fragments that fell from above, the
<i>ossuarium</i>, or charnel-house, being
cleared out, as necessity dictated,
through a doorway level with the outside
ground on the further or sinister
side of the building. It must have
been a thing quite unique in the
world, somewhat recalling the Towers
of Silence of the Parsees.</p>

<p>The mode of operation was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The executioner, in his rayed and
party-coloured habit of red and yellow,
mounted the ladder, placed opposite a
convenient space, backwards, holding
in his hand the slack ends of three
cords placed round the culprit’s neck;
two of these cords, “les tortouses,”
had slip-knots. The wretch under
treatment was encouraged to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
“le maistre des haultes œuvres,”
driven up after him&mdash;no doubt with
blows and execrations, according to
the Gallic fashion&mdash;and drawn forward
by him by means of the third cord,
“le jet.” Arrived at the proper
height, the operator, the mediæval
“Monsieur de Paris,” rapidly attached
the “tortouses” to the gallows, or
chain pendent from it, and, twisting
the “jet” firmly round his arm, by
means of this, and the action of his
knee, threw the culprit off the ladder
into mid-air; the knots of the “tortouses”
ran home, and the man was
strangled. The executioner then
gripped the crossbeam, and, placing
his feet in the loop formed by the
bound hands of the patient, by dint
of repeated vigorous shocks terminated
his sufferings.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>It may not be questioned that death
under the circumstances and complicated
conditions above described
cannot have been other than a very
shocking spectacle, and particularly
when it is noticed from the arrangement
of the chains that many a malefactor
may in his agony have broken
loose from his bonds, and clutched and
grappled in his last moments with a
decaying carcass at his side.</p>

<p>We can gather a further idea of the
strange and dismal appearance of the
Gibbet of Montfaucon, if we consider
that the quantity of bodies attached
to it, and ceaselessly renewed, attracted
thousands of carrion birds to
the spot. But that its hideous aspect
and pestilential surroundings prevented
not the establishment, in its
immediate vicinity, of places of
amusement and debauch, one would
almost have been slow to believe were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
it not for the testimony of ancient
poetry:&mdash;</p>

<p>So wrote Villon&mdash;also called Corbeuil,&mdash;in
the middle of the fifteenth
century. We shall have occasion,
later on, to show that human nature
on the hill of Montfaucon, in the
darkness of the Middle Ages, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
same as human nature in a great
English midland town in the enlightened
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Lavillegille tells us
that there was another and a smaller
gibbet, not far from Montfaucon,
called “Le gibet de Montigny.”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This
was to supply the place of the great
scarecrow, when the latter was under
repair, because, of course, Justice
never stands still. The bodies of
men decapitated, quartered, torn to
pieces by horses, or boiled, were hung
up in sacks of sackcloth or leather;
such as committed suicide also,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and
lay figures of persons condemned <i>in
contumaciam</i>. The corpse of the
great Captain Coligny, who was killed
in the massacre of St. Bartholomew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
August 24, 1572, was hung up by the
heels at the gibbet of Montfaucon.
L’Etoile reports that Catherine de
Medecis&mdash;“pour repâitre ses yeux”&mdash;went
to view him one evening.</p>

<p>It was the custom in France to try,
condemn, and hang on the gibbet, in
human clothing, certain animals under
special circumstances. So a sow, who
had killed a child, was hung up at
Montigny. A bull was similarly tried
and condemned for killing a man, but
whether the beast was gibbeted is not
recorded. It may be that the difficulty
and inconvenience of carrying
the matter out, or perhaps the trouble
to obtain garments large enough,
caused our fantastic neighbours to
draw the line at the bull. But we
may fairly admire the principle of
mediæval times, which seems to have
been that justice should be meted out
equally both to man and beast. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
pleasant to know that in many English
towns at the present day societies
are active in seeing that not only
simple justice, but, what is much
better for them, mercy also, is dealt
out to the poor dog, the poor horse,
the necessary or unnecessary cat,
and other harmless, helpless creatures.</p>

usually upon the gallows
after execution, the gallows
thus becoming the
gibbet. The following story is an
exemplification of this practice:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was my fortune at St. Domingo
to enter the Town-Church: accompanied
with two <i>French</i> Puppies,
mindful to shew me a miraculous
matter.</p>

<p>“Where, when come, I espied over
my head, opposite to the great Altar,
two milk-white Hens enravelled in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Iron Cage, on the inner-side of the
Porches <i>Promontore</i>. And demanding
why they were kept? or what
they signified? Certain <i>Spaniards</i>
replyed come along with us, and you
shall see the Story; and being
brought to the (<i>Choro</i>) it was drawn
thereon as followeth. The Father
and the Son, two <i>Bourboneons</i> of
<i>France</i>, going in Pilgrimage to St.
<i>James</i>, it was their lot to Lodg here
in an Inn: Where supper ended, and
reckoning paid, the Host perceiving
their denariate Charge, he entered
their Chamber, when they were
asleep, and in Bed, conveying his
own Purse in the young man’s
Budget.</p>

<p>“To-morrow early; the two innocent
Pilgrims, footing the hard
bruising way, were quickly over-hied
by the Justice; where the Host
making search for his Purse, found it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
in the Sons bagg. Whereupon instantly,
and in the same place he was
hanged, and left hanging there, seizing
on their money by a Sentential
forfeiture.</p>

<p>“The sorrowful Father (notwithstanding)
continued his Pilgrimage to
<i>Compostella</i>. Where, when come, and
Devotion made, our Lord of Mount
<i>Serata</i> appeared to him saying: <i>Thy
prayers are heard, and thy Groans
have pierced my heart, arise, and
return to Saint Domingo, for thy Son
liveth.</i> And he accordingly returned,
found it so, and the Son-hanged
Monster, after thirty days absence,
spoke thus from the Gallows, <i>Father
go to our Host, and shew him I live,
then speedily return.</i> By which direction
the old man entered the Town,
and finding the Host at Table, in
breaking up of two roasted Pullets,
told him, and said: <i>My son liveth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
come and see.</i> To which the smiling
Host replyd, he is as surely alive on
the Gallows, as these two Pullets be
alive in the Dish. At which Protestation,
the two fire-scorched Fowls
leapt out suddenly alive, with Heads,
Wings, Feathers, and Feet, and kekling
took flight thrice about the Table.
The which amazing sight, made the
astonished Host to confess his guiltiness,
and the other relieved from the
Rope, he was hung up in his place,
allotting his house for a Hospitality to
Pilgrims for ever.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Having an opportunity we made
inquiries in Holland. In that country
the procedure seems to have been
much the same as in France. Our
very obliging correspondent informs
us:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am convinced that criminals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
remained for a long time fastened to
the gallows after the execution. I
have in my possession a copy of an
old judgment, dating 1595, which, in
my opinion, gives full evidence of
what I advance, as this criminal also
remained there a long time afterwards.
It is written in old Dutch,
but let me try to translate it, perhaps
it may interest you:&mdash;‘The Sheriffs
of the city of Leyden,&mdash;Whereas the
demand and conclusion done and
taken by Lot. E. Huygengael, Mayor
of this city, against and on account of

by name or surname, at present being

yard of Graefstyn, in this city, where
criminals are usually punished, and
that it may there, by the executioner,
be hung by means of a string
on the gallows, between heaven and
earth, so that death may ensue;
further, that its dead body be dragged
on a stretcher into the gallows-field,
and that there it be suspended to the
gallows in horrification for all other
dogs, and as an example to everybody.
We further declare all his
assets, if it owns any, to be forfeited
and confiscated in favour of the
county of Holland and West-Friesland.

<p>“This dog had bitten J. J. van den
Poel’s baby, when playing at his
uncle’s house, where the child was
holding in his hand a piece of meat,
which the dog had seized, and so
bitten the child, and thus inflicted a
wound on the two fingers of the right
hand, through the skin to the flesh,

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="fstwd"><span class="hidden">F</span>rom</span> the stony horrors
of Paris, and the serio-grotesque
doings of the
Batavians, it will be a
relief to turn to the imagery of the
“Inspired Dreamer”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now I saw in my dream, that
they went on until they were come to
the place that Simple, and Sloth, and
Presumption, lay and slept in, when
Christian went by on pilgrimage: and
behold they were hanged up in irons,
a little way off on the other side.”</p>

<p>This was written between 1660 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
1670. It is to be observed that the
expression is “irons,” and not <i>chains</i>,
and that the fact is mentioned in a
simple, natural way, as if the mode of
punishment was quite usual for grave
offences. Christiana says&mdash;“They
should never be bewailed by me;
they have but what they deserve:
and I think it well that they stand so
near the highway, that others may
see and take warning.” And she
suggests that their crimes should be
engraved on an iron or brass plate,
and left “for a caution to other bad
men,” which Greatheart told her had
already been done. But Mercy, with
a lack of tenderness which her name
and fine earnest character do not
bespeak, cries out, “No, no, let them
hang, and their names rot, and their
crimes live for ever against them!”</p>

<p>The crimes in question were
combination against the truth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
opposition unto holiness, figuratively
deserving the highest punishment
that could be awarded.</p>

<p>In that strange, shameful, and
scarce book, “Le Moyen de Parvenir,”
by Beroalde de Verville, it is
recorded that when Charles V. made
his entry into Douai, the inhabitants
set up triumphal arches and like
embellishments. At the last moment
they bethought themselves of a
wretch who was gibbeted hard by
the gate of the principal entrance.
Him they therefore dressed in a clean
white shirt, to do honour to the
emperor.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It will be noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
they did not take the body away,
which would have been easier; that
would have been illegal.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further it must
be stated, as it were to clear the
ground, that there were certain
treasonable offences for which women
might be convicted, and it is to the
credit of the English law that the
solemn and terrible sentence was not
carried out upon them in its fulness,
so that, both for high treason and
petit treason, the sentence ordered
merely drawing to the gallows and
burning alive. This sentence was
modified in 30 George III. (1791)
to drawing, hanging, and dissecting.
It is similarly to the credit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
humanity that the bodies of women
were not publicly exposed on gibbets
in irons and chains.</p>

<p>In France the same feelings of
respect and propriety prevented the
hanging of women at the “fourches
patibulaires.” The sentence for
grave offences was that of “la
fosse,” or burying alive, usually in
front of the gibbet.</p>

<p>It will be convenient now to give a
variety of examples further illustrating
the subject specially under our notice.</p>

<p>We learn from the parish registers
of Bourne, in Cambridgeshire, that
Richard Foster, his wife, and his child,
were buried on Shrove Wednesday,
1671. All three were murdered on
the preceding Sunday by a miscreant
named George Atkins. He evaded
the law for seven years, but was
finally captured, hung, and gibbeted on
Caxton Common, adjoining Bourne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1674 Thomas Jackson, a notorious
highwayman, was executed for
the murder of Henry Miller. He
was hung in chains on a gibbet set
up between two elm trees on
Hampstead Heath, one of which
still remains, known as “Gallows
Tree.” Jackson left a “Recantation,”
which was printed in quarto form
immediately after his death. In this
rare tract “is truly discovered the
whole mystery of that Wicked and
Fatal Profession of Padding in the
Road.”</p>

<p>In 1687 a person named Bunbury
was barbarously murdered by one
Loseby, who was caught almost red-handed,
executed, and hung in chains
on the top of a tumulus on the
Watling Street Road, about four
miles from Rugby. The spot is
marked in Beighton’s map of Warwickshire,
from a survey made in 1725,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
as “Loseby’s Gibbet.” The tumulus
was demolished&mdash;as so many others
unfortunately have been&mdash;in the
latter part of the last century, on
the making of a turnpike road
between Daintry and Lutterworth.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
In modern maps the site of the
tumulus is forgotten, and the spot
being now known as “Gibbet Hill,”
the ancient history is wiped out, or,
perhaps, to put it more justly, one
kind of history replaces another, as
it ever has done, in the revolutions
of time, and an entirely new train
of thoughts is called up.</p>

<p>In 1690 one William Barwick,
while out walking with his wife at
Cawood, a few miles south of York,
threw her into a pond, drowned her,
drew her out, and buried her
then and there, in her clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Barwick’s brother-in-law’s suspicions
arose, and inquiries were set about;
the man confessed, and was duly
tried, condemned, and executed at
York, and hung in chains by the side
of the fatal pond. The curious part
of this case was that Barwick’s
brother-in-law was urged to move
in the matter in consequence of his
having seen, or fancied he saw&mdash;it
was all the same in, and long after,
the time of Matthew Hopkins<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>&mdash;a
few days after the murder, the
ghost of his sister, by the side of
the water, at twelve o’clock in the
daytime! And his deposition to
that effect was taken before the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Mayor on the day preceding the
trial.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Probably if Barwick had not confessed,
his case, in those times,
against such evidence as this, would
have been quite hopeless.</p>

<p>When the convicted man mounted
the gallows he naïvely told the hangman
that he hoped the rope was
strong enough, because, he said, if
it broke with his weight, he would
fall to the ground, and become a
cripple for life. His apprehensions
were quieted by the hangman’s assurance
that he might venture upon the
rope with perfect confidence. And
so it turned out, for it was, as
American speculators would say, a
“spot” transaction.</p>

<p>For examples in the early years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the eighteenth century, the following
will suffice; they show how thick
the gibbets were near London.</p>

<p>Edward Tooll, executed on Finchley
Common, Feb., 1700, and afterwards
hung in chains.&mdash;Michael Von
Berghem, and another, executed at
the Hartshorne Brewery, June, 1700,
and hung in chains, between Mile
End and Bow.&mdash;William Elby, executed
at Fulham, in the town,
Aug., 1707, and hung in chains there.&mdash;Hermann
Brian, executed in St.
James’s Street, near St. James’s
House, Oct., 1707, and hung in chains

other malefactors, and hung in chains.&mdash;Joseph
Still, executed on Stamford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="fstwd"><span class="hidden">I</span>t</span> will be recollected that
one of the most interesting
of Sir Walter Scott’s
novels, “The Pirate,” is
founded upon a case of piracy in the
Orkneys, in 1725.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The captain, John
Gow, and his crew, were secured, with
much courage and address, by a patriotic
inhabitant, James Fea, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
prisoners were prosecuted by the High
Court of Admiralty. The remarkable
part of this affair was that, on Gow
“standing mute,” that is, refusing to
plead, the judge ordered that he should
be brought to the bar and his thumbs
squeezed by two men with a whipcord
until it broke; that it should be
doubled, and then trebled, and that the
operators should pull with their whole
strength. This discipline Gow endured
with much fortitude, but when he had
seen the preparations for pressing
him to death&mdash;the <i>peine forte et dure</i>,&mdash;until
he died, or pleaded, his courage
gave way,&mdash;few men, especially
bad ones, can look unflinchingly into
the dark valley,&mdash;and he said he would
not have given so much trouble if he
could have been assured of not being
hung in chains. He was convicted,
hung, and gibbeted in the chains he so
much dreaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Apropos of the <i>peine forte et dure</i>,
in March, 1674, a man living at Cannock
was arraigned at the Stafford
Assizes for the murder of his father,
mother, and wife. He refused to plead,
but was adjudged guilty. For his contumacy
he was sentenced to undergo
the <i>peine forte et dure</i>, or, in other words
to be pressed to death. This was
carried out, as appears from a picture
in the Salt Library at Stafford, showing
the unhappy wretch lying on the
floor, with a board on his chest covered
with a number of heavy weights.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>This must have been a more dreadful
agony, while it lasted, than the
“little ease” or the “rack.” The
severity of the latter engine is sufficiently
attested by the signatures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Guy Fawkes before and after that
ordeal.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>In 1726 Mrs. Catherine Hayes was
burnt alive, doubtless for high or petit
treason.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>We gather from Howell’s <i>State</i>
Trials that when the English Regency
made an order, in 1742, to hang the
body of the murderer of Mr. Penny
in chains, they inserted therein that
it was on the petition of the relatives
of the deceased.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In 1742 John Breeds a butcher of
Rye, conceived a violent animosity
against Mr. Thomas Lamb of the
same place, and, as the old Statute of
High Treason would put it, “compassed
and imagined” his death. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
opportunity seemed to present itself
on the night of March 17th, on the
occasion of Mr. Lamb being about to
see a friend off by ship to France.
But, changing his mind at the last
moment, he requested his neighbour,
Mr. Grebble, to take his place, which
he did. Breeds, or, as he is called on
Mr. Grebble’s tombstone, the “sanguinary
butcher,” sharpened his knife
and took his station in the shadowy
churchyard, and soon rushed on the
unsuspecting Mr. Grebble, and mortally
stabbed him. The unfortunate
victim had strength enough to reach
his house, and sit himself in a chair,
out of which he very soon fell, and died,
to the great consternation of his servant,
who was at once suspected of
being the murderer. The conduct of
Breeds, however, soon cleared up all
doubts upon this point. He was tried,
and found guilty, and condemned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
death, and to be hung in chains. For
this purpose a gibbet was set up in a
marsh at the west end of the town
now called “Gibbet Marsh.” The
carcass of Breeds swung for many
years on the morass, and when all
but the upper part of the skull had
dropped away, the chains and frame
were rescued by the Corporation of
Rye, and have, by lapse of time,
acquired a kind of grim interest, if not
exactly to “adorn a tale,” at least
“to point a moral.”</p>

(<i>From a photograph.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>In 1747 Christopher Holliday was
beaten to death with his own staff by
a cold-blooded savage, Adam Graham,
on Beck Moor, near Balenbush, on
the English side of the Border. Graham
was executed at Carlisle, and his
body hung in chains upon a gibbet
twelve yards high, on Kingmoor, with
twelve thousand nails driven into it
to prevent it being swarmed, or cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
down, and the body carried off. The
murderer left a confession of several
other crimes, which was published at
the time in pamphlet form, and had a
large sale.</p>

<p>The smugglers also fell into the
dire clutches of the law for the good
reason that their vulgar atrocities deserved
the highest punishment. They
were not graceful villains like Claud
Duval, that hero of the mob, who is
said&mdash;but by disinterested witnesses&mdash;to
have quite charmed the victims
while he broke two of the commandments.
Thus William Carter, smuggler
and murderer, was executed and
hung up in chains near Rake, on the
Portsmouth road, in 1749.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Four
others, concerned in the same crime,
were similarly gibbeted. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
leg pieces of Carter’s irons is in the
collection of Lady Dorothy Nevill.
Implicated in this affair&mdash;namely,
the robbery of the Custom House at
Poole, and the murder of Mr. Galley
and Mr. Chater&mdash;was William Jackson.
He, also, was condemned to be
hung, and gibbeted in chains; but the
poor wretch was so ill, and horror-struck
when they measured him for
his irons, that he died of fright. His
body was thrown into a hole near
Carter’s gibbet. A memorial stone,
with a long inscription recording the
crime in which so many suffered, was
set up on the spot in 1749, and still
remains.</p>

<p>Under the pressure of a belief in
the extraordinary delusion of witchcraft,
a harmless and aged couple at
Tring,&mdash;who had been removed from
the workhouse to the church for safety,&mdash;were
seized and so shockingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
handled and ducked by a mob at Long
Marston, near Tring, in 1751, that the
woman, Ruth Osborne, died on the
spot. The ringleader, Thomas Colley,
was tried at Hertford, when the revolting
particulars of the barbarities
were proved. He was taken for
execution to Gubblecote Cross, in
Long Marston parish, thirty miles from
Hertford, and so great was the infatuation,
and sympathy for the man
who had “destroyed an old wicked
woman that had done so much mischief
by her witchcraft,” that a strong
escort of horse was necessary. The
body of Colley was afterwards hung
in chains on the same gallows, the
people of Long Marston, many of
whom were present at the murder,
having petitioned against the gibbeting
near their houses.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="fstwd"><span class="hidden">B</span>y</span> this time, as we have
seen, it had gradually become
usual for the court,
in atrocious cases, to direct
that the murderer’s body should be
hung upon a gibbet in chains, near
the place where the fact was committed;
but this was no part of the
legal judgment.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> By an Act of 25
George II. (1752) gibbeting in chains
was first legally recognized. By this
statute it was enacted that the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
should, after sentence delivered and
execution done, be given to the surgeons
to be dissected and anatomized,
and that the judge may direct the
body to be afterwards hung in chains,
but in no wise to be buried without
dissection.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>But still the gibbeting did not
form, as it never has formed, part
of the legal sentence.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The judge
could direct it to be carried out by a
special order to the sheriff,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and this
was sometimes done&mdash;as we have
seen in the case of Mr. Penny’s
murder in 1741&mdash;on the petition of
the relatives of the deceased. The
theory was that the body was at the
disposal of the Crown, and that an
order to hang in chains would be
granted on application to the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
authorities. This <i>post-mortem</i> revengement
was thought to be a singular
great comfort to the relatives of the
murdered man. The Roman law also
permitted the murderer’s body to remain
on the gibbet after execution,
as a comfortable sight to the relatives
of the deceased:&mdash;“Famosos latrones,
in his locis, ubi graffati sunt, furca
figendos placuit: ut et conspictu deterreantur
alii, et solatio sit cognatis
interemptorum.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The Act of 1752 seems to have
cleared the way considerably, and
from this date gibbetings rapidly increased.
It may here be recalled
that the idea of being gibbeted was
ever a very terrifying one to the
sufferer, and many a strong man who
had stood fearless under the dread
sentence broke down when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
measured for his irons. We may
inquire a little what was in prospect
for the caitiff that made the iron so
to enter into his soul.</p>

<p>At Newgate, which no doubt gave
the example to other prisons, it was
the custom, after execution, to convey
the body into a place grimly
called “the Kitchen.” Here stood
a caldron of boiling pitch, and into
this the carcass was thrown. It was
shortly after withdrawn, placed in the
chains, and these cold-rivetted&mdash;truly
enough “fast bound in misery and
iron.” We can picture the brutal
work, with, no doubt, the coarse jesting,
when the dead malefactor was
finally rivetted up in what was called
“his last suit.”</p>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<p>Occasionally the bodies were put into
sacks, and so hung up. In France
also, men in the fifteenth century
were drowned in sacks of leather;
hence the term “gens de sac et de
corde” for evilly-disposed persons at
the present day.</p>

<p>It is well known&mdash;for there is frequent
allusion to it in the literature
of the time&mdash;that travellers approaching
London and other large cities, in
the last century, were offended, both
in sight and in other ways, by the
number of dingy, dead, iron-bound
bodies that welcomed them. In remote
parts a gibbet had the effect
of diverting the slender traffic&mdash;at
least when night set in. Belated
wayfarers were grieved by the horrid
grating sound as the body in the iron
frame swung creaking to and fro.
Thus Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<p>And in the daytime these odd features
in an English landscape often proved
an attraction to flippant sporting men.</p>

<p>On the banks of the Thames, opposite
Blackwall, hung the bodies of
numerous pirates. The Rev. T.
Mozeley, in his “Reminiscences,”
tells us that “the only inhabitants
of the Isle of Dogs that I ever saw
were three murderers hanging from
a gibbet.” A correspondent tells us
“they looked like scarecrows.” One
of Hogarth’s pictures of “The Idle
Apprentice” series shows the pirates
hanging in the distance.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In later
times, in the windows of the waterside
taverns at Blackwall, “spy-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>glasses,”
or what Robinson Crusoe
called “perspective glasses,” were
fixed for people to enjoy the spectacle;
similarly the Greenwich pensioners
on the Hill used to exhibit
the gibbeted pirates on the opposite
side of the river, in the Isle of Dogs,
through telescopes; and when the
bodies were removed by legislative
enactment, some of the forward newspapers
of the day made an outcry
that the holiday-makers were deprived
of their amusements.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>In the same manner, at Northampton,
on the occasion of the last public
execution there, in 1852, thousands of
people gathered together, and were
painfully disappointed and turbulent
when they found the day had been
changed. Some of these worthies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
said if they could only get at the
under-sheriff “they would let him
know what it was to keep honest folk
in suspense,” one old woman loudly
declaring that she should claim her
expenses from the authorities.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The
New Drop set up at the Northampton
County Gaol in 1818 was of such
ample capacity that it was proudly
described by the governor as efficient
for the hanging of twelve persons
“comfortably.”<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In 1764 William Corbett was executed
on Kennington Common. His
body was “fixed in irons”&mdash;a new

<p>On November 16, 1766, Thomas
Parker called on his way from Penrith
Market at a small inn at Carlton.
Being somewhat the worse for drink,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the landlord urged him to remain, but
the shaggy sot pressed on his way,
and was murdered the same night.
The affair caused an extraordinary
local interest among a population who
had not forgotten the shocking incidents
of the punishments for the
Rebellion of twenty years before.
The poor muddled man had been
beaten to death by one Thomas
Nicholson, after a violent struggle
with the assassin. The murderer,
upon strong circumstantial evidence,
was sentenced to be executed, and
his body to be hung in chains near
where the crime was committed. It
so hung for many years, slowly dropping
to pieces, until on one stormy
night the gibbet was blown down.
Shortly after some humane persons
from Edenhall came and gathered
the desolate bones together, wrapped
them in a winnowing-sheet&mdash;it sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
like an episode from the Apocrypha,
like a good deed of Tobit&mdash;and
laid them in a grave. The spot was
long after distinguished by the letters,
large and legible, deeply cut in the
turf, “T. P. M.,” signifying “here
Thomas Parker was murdered.”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The hanging in chains of a man
named Corbet, of Tring, who murdered
Richard Holt in 1773, is noteworthy,
as the last instance of gibbeting
in the county of Buckingham.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>A notorious highwayman, John
Whitfield, was executed and gibbeted
on Barrock, near Wetheral, Cumberland,
about the year 1777. It is said
that he was gibbeted alive, and that
the guard of a passing mail-coach put
him out of his misery by shooting him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
If this were true the guard was clearly
guilty of murder. We shall have
occasion to revert to this question.
Later, a sergeant was reduced to the
ranks for shooting at the dead body
in chains of Jerry Abershaw, a
notorious brigand, on Wimbledon
Common.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1785 the Rev. Thomas
Kerrich made sketches of two men
hanging in chains upon one gibbet
on Brandon Sands, Suffolk. At the
present day all other record both of
the men (May and Tybald), their
crimes, and their punishment, has, like
the coral worm of the completed reef,
utterly passed away; all has succumbed
to “the tooth of time, and razure of
oblivion.” The gibbet post is shown
bound with iron bands to prevent
cutting down.</p>

<p>About the middle of the last century
three men who robbed the north mail
near the Chevin, over against Belper,
were all executed and hung in chains
on one gibbet on the top of the mountain.
“Now then, you three, hang
there, and be a sign.”<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>It is recorded that a friendly hand
set fire one night to the gibbet which,
with all three bodies well saturated
with pitch, was burnt to ashes, leaving
only the irons and chains remaining.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Not unduly to multiply instances we
may hurry on to 1788. In this year
the postboy between Warrington and
Northwich was robbed by William
Lewin. This was still a capital
offence, but the culprit evaded justice
for three years. Being finally over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>taken
he was executed at Chester,
and his body hung in chains on the
highest point of Helsby Tor, eight
miles from Chester, and visible, as it
was said, “with glasses,” even from
the Peak of Derbyshire. It was
evidently believed that the whole
country round would see and take
warning.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>There were then three gibbets between
Liverpool and Warrington.</p>

<p>But the system, like all violent
systems, was not deterrent&mdash;indeed, a

seems to affect the spectator rather as
a curious sight than as the necessary
and proper consequence of transgression.</p>

<p>Five months after the death of the
last-mentioned criminal, Edward Miles
was executed and hung in chains, not
only for robbing the mail, but for
murdering the postboy also. It was
a serious case, and the man was hung,
and gibbeted in irons on the Manchester
road, near the Twystes. These
irons, of a very careful manufacture,
were dug up on the spot in 1845, and
falling into the hands of the late Mr.
Beaumont, are now preserved in the
Warrington Museum.</p>

<p>In 1796 James Price and Thomas
Brown were hung in chains on one
gibbet at Trafford, between Chester
and Tarporley. A print in the account
of the trial shows the carcasses
in iron frames shaped to the body like
the Warrington example.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

1799 two brothers named Drewett, for
attacking the Portsmouth mail, in the
delightful district of Midhurst, were
executed on Horsham Common, and
their bodies taken to the scene of the
robbery, and hung up in irons. This
event still lingers in memory in the
district, and the more so, perhaps,
because the younger of the two convicts
is believed to have had the
nobility to suffer for his father, whose
guilt he would not disclose.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The
“last dying speeches” of these two
men, printed with uncouth verbiage,

failed to make themselves
acquainted with the works
of Bewick, the father of
English wood-engraving. In them we
have everything the most truthful and
poetical. Wide, wild moor, the desolation
of winter, with the solitary
worn-out horse, forgotten in the snowy
waste; the falling fane, the crumbling
tower; scenes on northern shores,&mdash;rocks
and sea-fowl, wrecks and tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>pests.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
He delights to show us in his
famous tailpieces such pictures as the
ragged rapscallions that abound in
streets, graceless and cruel; beggars
and strollers with bear, monkey, or
trumpet; lame soldiers and wounded
men, real or sham; the belated traveller
in the rain; the snow-man of our
childhood; the tipplers with their
delightful tall, twisted-stemmed wine-glasses,
all “regardless of their doom,”
or returning with faltering steps from
the tavern; the man on the stepping-stones,
bowed down with his burden,
the poor mewing cat turning round
and round at sea in a tub. Among
his principal engravings Bewick gives
us in his “Quadruped,” and with a
delicacy and force that no modern
workman has equalled, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the lion rearing a majestic crest, and
“we seem to hear his awful voice, rolling
like thunder along the ground, and
cowing all nature into silence;”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the
tiger with his fearful glittering eye,
that only Rubens or Rivière can paint.
Among birds we may recall the woodcuts
of the moping thoughtful owl;
the water ouzle, with his white waistcoat,
sacred to the rocks of the Dove;
and the carrion crow wheeling round
the gibbet. All these are capital
examples of Bewick’s skill; they are,
indeed, as fine as they can be, and
rendered with the magic touch, with
that wonderful feeling for nature which
just make the difference between the
plodding draughtsman and the born
artist. Many persons can “draw,” but
very few can draw even tolerably.
And Bewick chose, like Hogarth, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
portray humanity in some of its
degradations, and to call up our feelings
against violence and wickedness and
the abuse of man’s high quality. He
shrank not from the gibbet, he saw its
educational value, and, with absolute
fidelity, he gives us many examples
of the time-honoured horror, standing
out stark and bare against the bleak
sky.</p>

<p>In a late year of the last century a
man was hung in chains in the north
of England,&mdash;but the particular place
we have not been able to identify.

</div>
<p class="afterdrop"><span class="fstwd"><span class="hidden">A</span>bout</span> the year 1800 a man
named Watson was executed
at Lynn for the murder
of his wife and child. The
body was taken to Bradenham Heath,
and there gibbeted in irons. Some
few years ago the gibbet was still
standing, and at the foot of it Mr. H.
Rider Haggard and his brother found,
imbedded in the sod, the upper portion
of the iron framing, including the
headpiece, with a portion of the skull
remaining in it. So it had been withdrawn
from sight by kindly nature, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
her pitying mood, and covered by the
greensward. A lady of that neighbourhood,
who died a few years ago,
aged ninety-four, used to relate, that
when she was a girl, she once crossed
the gibbet common, and noticed that
a starling had built her nest in the
man’s ribs; later on some lovers of
nature came from Shipdam and stole
away the young birds. The remains
of Watson’s irons are now deposited
in the Norwich Gaol, among a very
interesting collection of chains, gyves,
irons, gang-chains, and burning girths
for the “pale martyrs in their shirts
of fire.”</p>

<p>A noteworthy feature in this case
was, as in that of John Whitfield,
before mentioned, that it got about, in
latter days, in the neighbourhood, that
the man had been hung up alive, and
watched till he died. Similarly, we
have a story from Durham, showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
that one Andrew Mills, gibbeted alive
in 1684, for murdering his master’s
three children, was kept in existence
for some time by his sweetheart (of
course), who, until she was prevented,
gave him milk in a sponge at the end
of a stick.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>These kind of stories usually fall
to pieces when they are examined,
and it so happens that on the tombstone
of the three unfortunate little
children, in Merrington churchyard, are
the words:&mdash;“He was executed and
afterwards hung in chains”; but “<i>executed
and</i>” have been nearly obliterated
by deep chisel marks,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> thus forming at
once both the <i>post hoc</i> and the <i>propter
hoc</i> of the story. As to the milk, and
the sweetheart, this part of the fable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
is nothing but a free rendering&mdash;necessary
under the circumstances&mdash;of
the classical legends of Euphrasia
and Evander, of Xantippe and Cimonos.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Tradition often does, but just
as often&mdash;or oftener does not justify
itself.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>This suggests a few words upon the
question of hanging alive in chains.
Hollingshed, in his “Description of
England”<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> says:&mdash;“In wilful murder
done upon pretended (premeditated)
malice, or in anie notable robbery,”
the criminal “is either hanged alive
in chains near the place where the
fact was committed, or else, upon
compassion taken, first strangled with
a rope, and so continueth till his bones
come to nothing.” Chettle, in “England’s
Mourning Garment,”<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> speaking
of the clemency of Elizabeth, says:&mdash;“Where-as
before time there was extraordinary
torture, as hanging wilfull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
murderers alive in chaines; she having
compassion ... said their death satisfied
for death.”</p>

<p>These, and many other similar
arbitrary statements, might seem conclusive
evidence; but, on the other
hand, the “Statutes at Large” may be
vainly searched to find one directing
the punishment of gibbeting alive.
And when we recall the calm language
in which persons are directed by statute
to be boiled, disembowelled, or
burnt alive, we may be quite sure that,
if the English law had ever contemplated
the infliction upon a subject
of such lingering torture as gibbeting
alive, it would have been as coldly
and legally set forth, and, by this time,
as legally repealed,&mdash;which is perhaps,
more to the point still. And, further,
it is difficult to believe that any
English official would, at any time,&mdash;whether
under the pressure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
hardening influences of religious intolerance,
or politics,&mdash;have taken upon
himself so serious a responsibility, or
that any section of the English people
would have suffered such wanton barbarity.
The conclusion we are happily
driven to is that both Hollingshed,
Chettle, and all the old and modern
hare-brained irresponsible chatterers
have been carried away by a superstitious
belief in a poor, vulgar fiction,
“a vain thing fondly imagined,”
and to which the multitude of to-day
still appear to cling with a fatuous devotion
which, probably, no amount of
education or refutation will ever entirely
eradicate. This shows the
strong vitality of fiction.</p>

<p>With regard to the punishment of
hanging and boiling, alluded to above,
a single example will suffice. After
the suppression of the Northern Rising
the king attacked the Friars. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
popularity and poverty alike had saved
them when the lesser monasteries fell;
but their independence and boldness,
in preaching against the Marriage
question and the Supremacy, proved
their ruin. Those who had not fled
the country were treated with the
utmost harshness. Thus Father Stone,
an Austin Friar of Canterbury, for
obstinately maintaining his opinion
that the king may not be head of the
Church of England, was hung, cut
down, and his body boiled and quartered,
as appears from the following
very curious document preserved
among the records of the city of
Canterbury:&mdash;“<span class="small">A.D.</span> 1538-9. Paid for
half a ton of timber to make a pair
of gallaces to hang Father Stone.
For a carpenter for making the same
gallows and the dray. For a labourer
who digged the holes. To four men
who helped to set up the gallows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
For drink to them. For carriage of the
timber from stable gate to the dungeon.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
For a hurdle. For a load
of wood, and for a horse to draw
him to the dungeon. For two men
who set the kettle and parboiled him.
To two men who carried his quarters
to the gate and set them up. For a
halter to hang him. For two half-penny
halters. For Sandwich cord.
For straw. To the women that
scoured the kettle. To him that did
execution.”<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>An obliging correspondent tells us
that he remembers riding with his
father, in 1819, under a gibbet near
Evesham, and the creaking of the
irons as they were swayed by the
wind.</p>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="fstwd"><span class="hidden">T</span>owards</span> the year 1808 a
man named Thomas Otter,
<i>alias</i> “Tom Temporal,”
was hung at Lincoln for
the murder of a woman with whom he
cohabited there. It appears that she
had followed him when returning into
Nottinghamshire where his wife lived.
At the junction of the two counties
he turned on her, like a wild beast,
and slew her&mdash;in a lane near Saxilby,
still called “Gibbet Lane”&mdash;and flung
the body into a drain dividing the two
counties. Not exactly knowing which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
way to go at the moment,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the bewildered
miscreant fled back as quickly
as he could to Lincoln, was captured,
and nearly proved an <i>alibi</i> at the trial.
But he was convicted and executed,
and hung in chains on the fatal spot.
This custom had then, fortunately,
fallen somewhat into disuse; but even
desuetude had its drawbacks, for
crowds came to see the spectacle,&mdash;just
as all Sheffield and Rotherham
flocked to the gibbet of that famous
highwayman, Spence Broughton, on
Attercliffe Common in 1792, and a
stall with that curious cloying refreshment&mdash;gingerbread&mdash;was
set up, after
the English rural fashion. Subsequently
some inquiring tomtits were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
attracted, and made their nest, and
hatched seven young ones, in the
upper part of the iron frame where
the head was fixed; and a local poet,
in the fulness of his heart, produced
the following riddle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“10 tongues in one head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">9 living and one dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I flew forth to fetch some bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed the living in the dead.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="center">(Answer) “The tomtit that built in Tommy
Otter’s head.”</p>

<p>Years after, our informant,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> riding in
Gibbet Lane, came to the gibbet and
saw bones and rags of clothing lying
upon the ground, and the skull remaining
in the iron headpiece. Parts
of these irons are now preserved at
Doddington Hall, near Lincoln.</p>

<p>Another courteous correspondent<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
informs us that nearly seventy years
ago, in Malta, on the occasion of a
public festival, the body of one of two
brothers, between whom a feud had
long existed, was found murdered.
Circumstantial evidence pointed so
strongly to the survivor as the assassin
that he was tried, condemned, and
executed. In accordance with the
Code Rohan, the right hand was
separated from the body, and gibbeted
in an iron cage. Some years had
passed by when a man dying in the
Civil Hospital confessed himself to be
the murderer; he earnestly begged
that something might be done to
remove the stain from the memory of
the blameless brother, and presently
passed away. The gibbeted hand
was now lowered and followed to a
grave by an impulsive multitude in
sobs and tears, uttering prayers and
entreaties for the repose of the soul of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the innocent victim, and trusting that
the ordeal of martyrdom through
which he had passed in this world
might prove to him a crown of glory
in the next.</p>

<p>The same correspondent vividly recalls
the bodies of pirates hung in
chains on the walls of the fort of
Ricasoli, at the entrance to the harbour
of the island of Malta, as seen
by him in 1822.</p>

<p>“A Lady Pioneer” describes an
ancient rusty cage, here illustrated,
seen hanging from a tree by a friend
in Eastern Bengal. This was said to
have been used as a punishment for
dacoits, the tradition being that they
were hung up alive.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The shape and
careful manufacture almost seem to
bear this out. In the Asiatic Society’s
Museum at Calcutta an iron apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
for the same purpose is preserved.
Another exists in Jamaica, and to both
the same legend is attached.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

(<i>From an engraving in “The Indian Alps.”</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>In the year 1827 a chimney-sweep
committed a murder on the high road
near Brigg, and was tried at Lincoln.
It so happened that the new Assize
Courts were then being erected, and
the Dean and Chapter lent their
majestic Chapter House for the trial.
This building was temporarily fitted
up as a criminal court, the trial took
place in it, and lasted all day, and in
the deepening gloom, under the shadow
of St. Hugh’s great minster, Judge
Best sentenced the prisoner to death,
and ordered the body to be hung in
chains on the spot where the crime
was committed. It is well remembered,
by a gentleman who was present, what
a strange, solemn, and striking scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
it was. The inhabitants of Brigg
petitioned against the gibbeting, on
account of the scene of the murder
being so very near the town, and this
horror was accordingly remitted.</p>

<p>In 1832, on the occasion of a pitmen’s
strike at Shields, Mr. Nicholas
Fairles was the only resident magistrate,
and, as such, had to take active
steps to preserve the peace. On June
11th he was riding to Jarrow Colliery
when he was attacked and pulled from
his horse by two men, and so ill-treated
that he died on the 21st. One of the
men escaped, the other, William Jobling,
was taken, tried at Durham, and
hung on August 3rd. The body was
escorted by soldiers to Jarrow Slake,
stripped, covered with pitch, and reclothed.
It was then carefully encased
in a framework of iron,&mdash;the face being
wrapped in a white cloth,&mdash;and hung
on a gibbet twenty-one feet high and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
bound with iron bands. The post was
fixed into a stone of one and a half
tons’ weight which was sunk into the
Slake about a hundred yards within
high-water mark, and nearly opposite
the spot where the murder was committed.
Jobling’s gibbet was covered
for about five feet up by the high tide.
During the dark night of August 31st
the body was stolen away, and is said
to have been buried in the south-west
corner of Jarrow churchyard.</p>

<p>It is a curious coincidence that while
these pages have been passing through
the press Jobling’s widow has died
(April 14, 1891) at the great age of
ninety-six. Thus the last personal
link with the Gibbet has been severed.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>The last example of hanging in
chains:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">“Last scene of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ends this strange eventful history,”<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>is that of a man named Cook, a bookbinder,
who murdered Mr. Paas, with
the iron handle of his press, at Leicester,
in 1834. He was sentenced to death,
and the body ordered to be gibbeted.
This was done in Saffron Lane, outside
the town, and the disgraceful
scene around the gibbet, as described
by an eye-witness, was like a fair. A
Dissenter mounted upon a barrel and
preached to the people, who only
ridiculed him, and the general rioting
soon led to an order for the removal
of the body.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In the same year (4
William IV.) Hanging in Chains was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
abolished by statute. The irons
which proved so strong a magnet
are now preserved in Leicester Gaol.</p>

<p>Finally, an accomplished Northamptonshire
antiquary<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> informs us that
many years ago he came to a lone hill
at Elsdon, near Morpeth, in Northumberland,
and found a gibbet with a
wooden head hanging from it; this
still exists. It seems that the murderer,
whose crime it recorded, William Winter,
who slew Margaret Crozier, in
1791, sat down to his lunch in a
sheep-fold, and a curious shepherd-boy
abstractedly counted the nails in his
boots, and noticed his peculiar knife,
and this led to his apprehension. The
wooden head is a memorial of the
savage past, a relic of “the good old
times,” which we may truly rejoice to
think have passed away for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>We have now dealt with some of
the changeless passions in what the
immortal Castaway calls “that strange
chequer-work of Providence, the life of
man.” We have traversed the gory
path of dishonour from end to end, at
times with wide steps, a way often
obscure, and ever slippery with blood.
It has not been necessary to go to
mendacious chroniclers, or scandalous
diaries, for this story of man’s high
nature in some of its degradations, for
we have, verily, as in the “Visions of
Mirza,”<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> essayed to cross the bridge
over the Vale of Misery; we have
“unloaded all the gibbets, and pressed
the dead bodies.”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>It has been impossible to treat of
such a ghastly subject&mdash;of which the
horrors seem to burn themselves into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the mind&mdash;without a certain amount
of ghastliness; indeed, without the
plea of attempting to throw a ray of
light into some of these dark corners
of history, we should almost have
flinched from bringing forward these
melancholy topics, making sensibility
shudder, and which our readers may,
perchance, find it a pleasure to forget.
And in imagination we already hear
the cry&mdash;</p>

would be incomplete without a reference to the
<i>Halifax Gibbet</i>. This instrument of speedy but
rough justice resembles the <i>Guillotine</i>. It remained
in use until 1650, and records exist
showing how numerous were the sufferers under
its swift blade. The Earl of Morton, passing
through Halifax about the middle of the sixteenth
century, witnessed an execution, and is
said to have been so much pleased with it that
he had a similar machine made for Scotland,
where he was Regent. It long remained unused
under the name of “The Maiden.” But on
June 3, 1587, the Regent was himself executed
by it. Thus, as we have it in Hudibras, he
“made a rod for his own breech.” The Maiden
is now preserved in the Museum of the Society
of Antiquaries of Scotland, at Edinburgh.&mdash;<i>See</i>

of Wallace’s execution, and transmitting the
quarters to Scotland, was 61s. 10d. “He was
take and broute onto London, hanged, and
drawn, and quartered; his hed sette on London
brigge; his body dyvyded in iiij quarteres and
sent to foure tounes in Scotland” (Capgrave’s
“Chronicles”). Wallace was hung, cut down
alive, opened, his bowels, &amp;c., burnt, beheaded,
and finally quartered. Newcastle had his brave
right arm, the left went to Berwick, Perth
received the right leg, and Aberdeen the left.
Thus the patriot was broken up.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The battle of Shrewsbury was fought July
21, 1403, and the four quarters of Hotspur were
divided between London, Shrewsbury, Chester,
and Newcastle. York had the head. Four
months later, namely, November 3rd., a writ was
directed to the mayor and sheriffs of York, as
follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“The King to the Mayor and Sheriffs of the
city of York, greeting.&mdash;Whereas of our special
grace we have granted to our Cousin Elizabeth,
who was the wife of Henry de Percy, Chivalier,
the head and quarters of the same Henry to be
buried: We command you that the head aforesaid,
placed by our command upon the gate of
the city aforesaid, you deliver to the same
Elizabeth, to be buried according to our grant
aforesaid. Witness the king at Cirencester, this
3rd day of November.”
</p>
<p>
By writ of Privy Seal:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“The King to the Mayor and Sheriff of the
town of Newcastle-on-Tyne, greeting.&mdash;Whereas
(&amp;c., &amp;c., as above) you deliver to the said
Elizabeth a certain quarter of the said Henry
placed upon the gate” (&amp;c., &amp;c., as above).
</p>
<p>
Similar writs were directed to the Mayor and
Bailiffs of Chester, and to the authorities at
Shrewsbury for other several quarters of the
same Henry, and to the Abbot of Shrewsbury a
writ was addressed directing him to bury the
body of Hotspur, thus again brought together,
in his church of St. Peter at Shrewsbury. The
fourth quarter, that sent to distant London, does
not appear to have been forthcoming, for reasons
which will be apparent. See Rev. C. H.
Hartshorne’s “Feudal and Military Antiquities
of Northumberland and the Scottish Borders,”

this was reduced to 127, the total number condemned
to death being 86. Lords Balmerino
and Kilmarnock were beheaded for “the &mdash;45,”
August 18, 1746. They behaved with much
dignity and fortitude. The former expressed
his wish to Lord Kilmarnock, just before the
execution, that he wished he could suffer for
them both; <i>noblesse oblige</i>, even on the scaffold.
By their particular request their heads were not
severally held up and exposed by the executioner
with the usual formula&mdash;“This is the head of a
traitor.” But the sheriffs directed that everybody
on the scaffold should kneel down, so that
the people might see the execution itself performed&mdash;a
ceremony never practised before.
(“Account of the Behaviour,” &amp;c., by T. Forde,
a gentleman then present, 1746.)</p></div>

25 Edward III. (1351), is divided by Blackstone
into seven distinct branches. The first is “compassing
or imagining the death of the King, the
Queen, or their eldest son and heir.” 2. “Violating
the King’s companion, or the King’s
eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the
King’s eldest son and heir.” 3. “Levying war
against the King in his realm.” 4. “Adhering
to the King’s enemies in his realm, or elsewhere.”
5. “Counterfeiting the King’s great or privy
seal.” 6. “Counterfeiting the King’s money.”
7. “Slaying the chancellor, treasurer, or any of
the King’s justices, being in their places, doing
their offices.” (Blackstone’s, Comm. vol. iv. p.
76).
</p>
<p>
Petit Treason is aggravated murder, according
to the same Statute; and may happen in three
ways: 1. “By a servant killing his master.” 2.
“By a wife killing her husband.” 3. “By an
ecclesiastic killing his superior.” (Blackstone, <i>ib.</i>
p. 202).</p></div>

Ambrose Gwinnett, who, according to his own
statement, was hung, and hung in chains at
Deal in 1709, and came to life again, and
escaped to Florida. But, what is more extraordinary
still, he fell in with the very man he
was supposed to have murdered, survived him for
many years, and long swept the way at Charing
